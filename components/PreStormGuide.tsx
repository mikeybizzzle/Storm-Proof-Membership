        Proper documentation of your property's condition before storm season is one of the most 
        important steps you can take to protect your insurance coverage. This comprehensive guide 
        will walk you through the exact photos you need to take and how to take them properly.

      <CalloutBlock type="warning" title="Important Safety Notice">
        <strong>DO NOT get on your roof unless you are trained, properly equipped, and physically capable.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Falls are a leading cause of home inspection injuries. If in doubt, document from the ground 
        or hire a professional. Your safety is worth more than any insurance claim.
      </CalloutBlock>

      <HeadingBlock level={2}>Why Pre-Storm Documentation Matters</HeadingBlock>
      
      <TextBlock>
        Insurance companies are increasingly denying claims based on "pre-existing damage" or "lack of maintenance." 
        By having comprehensive before-and-after photos, you can prove that damage occurred during a specific storm event.

      <TextBlock>
        â€¢ Smartphone or digital camera with date/time stamp enabled<br />
        â€¢ Measuring tape or ruler for scale reference<br />

      <HeadingBlock level={3}>Photo Quality Requirements</HeadingBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        â€¢ <strong>Resolution:</strong> Use the highest quality setting available<br />
        â€¢ <strong>Focus:</strong> Ensure all photos are sharp and clear<br />
        â€¢ <strong>Lighting:</strong> Take photos during daylight hours when possible<br />
        â€¢ <strong>Scale:</strong> Include reference objects to show size of any damage<br />
        â€¢ <strong>Angles:</strong> Take multiple angles of the same area
      </TextBlock>

      <CalloutBlock type="info" title="Professional Tip">
        Take photos from the same positions each season. This creates a consistent record 
        that makes it easier to spot changes and prove when damage occurred.

      <HeadingBlock level={2}>Organizing Your Photos</HeadingBlock>
      
      <TextBlock>
        Proper organization is just as important as taking the photos. Create folders by date 
        and label each photo with its location and purpose.
